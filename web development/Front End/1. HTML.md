# HTML

# Why is it used?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used **to structure a web page and its content**.

It is mainly based and used with help of tags. Some of these tags are: 

### Heading Tag

it has six sizes has h1 to h6

used to display the headings

usual syntax :
``` html
    <h1> content </h1>

### Paragraph Tag

it has only open and closing

used to differentiate paragraphs  

usual syntax :
**<p> content </p>**

### Pre-formatted Text Tag

it has opening and closing tag 

used to format the text and make the text like look how it is written.

usual syntax :<pre>……………</pre>

## **VOID ELEMENT**

### Horizontal Rule

it has only one tag 

used to draw the horizontal line

usual syntax :<hr/>

### Break Tag

it has only one tag 

used to break the line and make the other content come from next line.

usual syntax :<br/> or also <br>

## **ATTRIBUTES**

Attributes are additional information that can be added to HTML elements to change their appearance or behavior. 

For example, the `<img>` element has an `src` attribute that specifies the URL of the image to be displayed.

The `<a>` element has a `href` attribute that specifies the URL of the link.

### DRAGGABLE ATTRIBUTE

The draggable attribute is used to make an element draggable. 

When an element is draggable, it can be moved around the page by clicking and dragging on it.
syntax:     **`draggable="true|false"`**
If the value of the draggable attribute is `true`, the element will be draggable else if it is "false" it is not draggable. 
The draggable attribute can be used on any element, but it is most commonly used on elements that represent objects that can be moved around, such as images, text boxes, and buttons.
When an element is draggable, it will have a cursor that changes to a hand when the mouse is over it. This indicates that the element can be dragged.
To drag an element, click and hold down the mouse button on the element. Then, move the mouse around to move the element.
When you release the mouse button, the element will be dropped at its new location.
The draggable attribute can be used with the `ondragstart` and `ondragend` events to perform custom actions when an element is dragged.
The `ondragstart` event is fired when an element is started being dragged. The `ondragend` event is fired when an element is stopped being dragged.

## **LISTS**

### Ordered Lists

The ordered list element is used to create a list of items in a specific order. 

The items in the list are numbered sequentially, starting with 1. The following code shows an example of an ordered list:

**`<ol>`
  `<li>Item 1</li>`
  `<li>Item 2</li>`
  `<li>Item 3</li>`
`</ol>`**

The ordered list element has the following attributes:
* `start`: The number at which the list should start. By default, the list starts at 1. eg <ol start = 5>
* `type`: The type of list to create. The possible values are `1`, `a`, `A`, `i`, and `I`. The default value is `1`.
The ordered list element can also be nested inside another ordered list. The following code shows an example of a nested ordered list:

### Unordered lists

The unordered list element is used to create a list of items that are not in a specific order. 

The items in the list are typically preceded by a bullet point. The following code shows an example of an unordered list:

**`<ul>`
`<li>Item 1</li>`
`<li>Item 2</li>`
`<li>Item 3</li>`
`</ul>`**
The unordered list element has the following attributes:
* `type`: The type of list to create. The possible values are `disc`, `circle`, and `square`. The default value is `disc`.
* `start`: The number at which the list should start. By default, the list starts at 1.
The unordered list element can also be nested inside another unordered list. The following code shows an example of a nested unordered list:

**You can also make sublists and nested lists**

### Anchor Tag

The anchor tag is used to create a link to another page or website. 

The anchor tag has two parts: the `<a>` tag and the `</a>` tag. 

The `<a>` tag contains the text that will be displayed as the link, and the `</a>` tag closes the link.
The following code shows an example of an anchor tag:

**`<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>`**

### Image Tag

The image tag is used to insert an image into a web page. The image tag has the following syntax:

**`<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">`**
The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image file. 

The `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.
The image tag can also have a number of other attributes, such as `width`, `height`, `align`, and `border`. These attributes can be used to control the size, alignment, and border of the image.
The image tag is a very versatile tag that can be used to add images to a web page in a variety of ways.

## Embedding link in an image

To embed a link in an image, you can use the `<a>` tag. The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks, which are links that allow you to navigate to other web pages.
To create a hyperlink, you need to specify the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the web page that you want to link to.
For example, the following code creates a hyperlink to the Google homepage:

**`<a href="https://www.google.com"><img src="image.jpg"></a>`**
This code will create an image that links to the Google homepage.
You can also use the `<a>` tag to create links to other parts of the same web page. To do this, you need to specify the `href` attribute with the ID of the element that you want to link to.``

## Basic Html Boilerplate

The HTML boilerplate is the basic structure of an HTML document. It includes the following elements:
* `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This element specifies the document type.
* `<html>`: This element marks the beginning of the document.
* `<head>`: This element contains the metadata for the document, such as the title, the author, and the keywords.
* `<body>`: This element contains the main content of the document.
Here is an example of an HTML boilerplate:

**`<!DOCTYPE html>`
`<html>`
 `<head>`
   `<title>My First HTML Document</title>`
 `</head>`
 `<body>`
   `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`**

 **`</body>`
`</html>`**

## **divisions <div>**

In HTML, the `<div>` tag is a fundamental element used to create a container or division within a web page. It is a block-level element that is commonly used for grouping and structuring content, and it does not have any specific styling or visual characteristics by default. Instead, it is often used in combination with CSS to apply styles and layout to its contents. Here's the basic syntax for the `<div>` tag:

```html
<div>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>

```

You can also add attributes to the `<div>` tag to provide additional information or to target it with CSS or JavaScript. For example, you can give it an `id` or `class` attribute like this:

```html
<div id="myDiv">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>

<div class="container">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>

```

The `id` attribute should be unique on the page, and it allows you to uniquely identify the `<div>` for JavaScript and CSS targeting. The `class` attribute, on the other hand, can be used to group multiple elements together, making it easier to apply the same styles or behaviors to them.

Here's an example of how you might use the `<div>` tag to structure your HTML content:

```html
<div id="header">
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
</div>

<div id="main-content">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are a company that does amazing things.</p>
</div>

<div id="footer">
    <p>&copy; 2023 My Website</p>
</div>

```

In this example, we have used `<div>` elements to create a header, main content section, and footer for a simple web page. You can apply CSS styles to these `<div>` elements to control their appearance and layout on the page.

Yes, you can use both the `id` and `class` attributes on the same `<div>` element (or any HTML element) if needed. The `id` attribute is typically used to uniquely identify a specific element on a web page, while the `class` attribute can be used to group multiple elements together based on shared characteristics.

Here's an example of how you can use both the `id` and `class` attributes on a `<div>` element:

```html
<div id="unique-element" class="common-element">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>

```

In this example, the `id` attribute is set to "unique-element," making this particular `<div>` uniquely identifiable on the page. The `class` attribute is set to "common-element," which can be used to group this element with other elements that share the "common-element" class.

You can then use CSS or JavaScript to target the element by its unique `id` or by its shared class, depending on your specific needs. For example, using CSS:

```css
#unique-element {
    /* Styles specific to the element with the "unique-element" id */
}

.common-element {
    /* Styles shared by all elements with the "common-element" class */
}

```

In this way, you have the flexibility to both uniquely identify an element and apply styles or functionality to multiple elements that share common characteristics.

To apply styles to class and ID elements in HTML and CSS, you can use CSS selectors. Here's how you can target and style both class and ID elements:

1. Styling Class Elements:
    
    To style elements with a particular class, you use the class selector (dot `.` followed by the class name) in your CSS. For example, if you have the following HTML element with a class:
    
    ```html
    <div class="my-class">This is a div with a class</div>
    
    ```
    
    You can style it with the following CSS:
    
    ```css
    .my-class {
        color: red; /* Example style for elements with the "my-class" class */
    }
    
    ```
    
2. Styling ID Elements:
    
    To style an element with a specific ID, you use the ID selector (hash `#` followed by the ID name) in your CSS. For example, if you have the following HTML element with an ID:
    
    ```html
    <div id="my-id">This is a div with an ID</div>
    
    ```
    
    You can style it with the following CSS:
    
    ```css
    #my-id {
        background-color: yellow; /* Example style for the element with the "my-id" ID */
    }
    
    ```
    

It's important to note that IDs should be unique on a page, meaning you should only have one element with a specific ID. Classes, on the other hand, can be applied to multiple elements, allowing you to style multiple elements with the same class using a single CSS rule.

Here's a more complete example:

HTML:

```html
<div id="unique-element">This is an element with an ID.</div>
<div class="common-element">This is an element with a class.</div>
<div class="common-element">This is another element with the same class.</div>

```

CSS:

```css
#unique-element {
    color: blue; /* Styles the element with the "unique-element" ID */
}

.common-element {
    background-color: lightgray; /* Styles elements with the "common-element" class */
}

```

In this example, the element with the ID "unique-element" is styled differently from the elements with the class "common-element."

div class = “header”

div class = “navbar”

li a:hover{ 

    background-color: ;

  color:    ;

}
