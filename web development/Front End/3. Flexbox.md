## Here's an explanation of each of the common CSS Flexbox properties and their sub-properties or options:
1. **display:**

  - `**flex**`: This value makes the element a flex container, and its children become flex items.   - 

`inline-flex`: Similar to `flex`, but it's an inline-level container, suitable for inline elements like `<span>`.

## 2. flex-direction:

- `row`: Items are placed in the same direction as the text (left to right).   

- `row-reverse`: Items are placed in the reverse direction (right to left).  

 - `column`: Items are placed in a column, top to bottom.  

 - `column-reverse`: Items are placed in a column in reverse (bottom to top)

## .3.flex-wrap:   -

`nowrap`: All items are forced into a single line.   -

 `wrap`: Items wrap onto multiple lines if needed.   - 

`wrap-reverse`: Items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order

## .4. `justify-content`:

- `flex-start`: Items are packed toward the start of the flex container.  

 - `flex-end`: Items are packed toward the end of the flex container.  

 - `center`: Items are centered along the line.   

- `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.

   - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.

   - `space-evenly`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them, including before the first and after the last item.

## 5. align-items:

 - `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the cross-axis.  

 - `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the cross-axis.  

 - `center`: Items are centered along the cross-axis.  

 - `baseline`: Items are aligned to their baselines. 

  - `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container (default).

## 6. align-content:

- `flex-start`: Lines are packed at the start of the container.

   - `flex-end`: Lines are packed at the end of the container.  

 - `center`: Lines are centered in the container.   

- `space-between`: Lines are evenly distributed, with the first line at the start and the last line at the end.   

- `space-around`: Lines are evenly distributed with equal space around them.  

 - `stretch`: Lines are stretched to fill the container (default).

## 7. flex-grow:

 - Numeric value: Determines how much an item grows relative to the other items. A higher value makes it grow more.

## 8. flex-shrink:

- Numeric value: Determines how much an item shrinks relative to the other items when there's not enough space.

## 9. flex-basis:

  - `auto`: The default size based on the item's content.   - Numeric value: Specifies the initial size of the item before free space is distributed.

## 10. order

- Numeric value: Controls the order in which flex items appear within the flex container. Lower values come first.
